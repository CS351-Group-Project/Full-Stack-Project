During week of 11/9:
* Refinement & Polish:
    * Focus on visual design and cultural expression (fonts, colors, layout that reflect Vietnamese aesthetics).
    * Fix weak points in functionality (bugs, performance).
    * Possibly visit office hours for technical feedback.

#1 idea - Deepikka
**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4:**
A lot of mythical stories like Greek Mythology stories have been long gone. I studied about them in middle school and haven't heard about them since. These stories hold a lot of wisdom and values within the stories and were passed through generations. They are not only entertaining, but also carry a lot of deep meanings about identity, resilience, and belonging.

**Implementation 4:**
Will create a web-based interactive story that brings such mythical stories to life and can have the users guide the characters through the story by making the decisions for them and experience the same lessons that were taught in the stories.

#2 Idea 
**Saanvi-Idea - Story - Inspiration 5:**
Starting college made me realize how quickly special moments pass by. I take photos of events but rarely capture the feelings behind them - like being nervous during orientation or discovering my favorite study spot. I want to create a simple way for students to preserve their college journey through storytelling, making a digital time capsule to look back on years later.

**Implementation 5:**
Build a web app where students create diary entries with photos, short voice recordings, and text about daily experiences. Users can tag entries by location or milestone, view their timeline chronologically, and share memories with friends. At graduation, the app generates a personalized "College Story Book" digital collection of their four-year journey.

#3 Idea - Mithil
Cultural Recipe Generator

Storytelling:
Rather than presenting recipes as simple instructions, the app frames each dish as a cultural experience. Users not only learn how to cook, but also gain insight into the traditions, history, and personal stories that make each dish unique and meaningful.

Implementation:
Concept:
   The Cultural Recipe Generator is a web-based application that combines culinary exploration with interactive storytelling. Users can discover traditional or fusion recipes while learning about the cultural, historical stories behind each dish.

Features:
   Ingredient-Based Suggestions: Users input ingredients or preferences, and the app suggests culturally inspired dishes.
   Storytelling for Each Recipe: Every recipe includes a narrative explaining its origin, cultural significance, or family tradition.
   Save, Share, and Contribute: Users can save favorite recipes, share them with friends, or contribute their own personal variations.
   Multimedia Support: Recipes include images, step-by-step videos, and optional audio narration to enhance engagement.
