# Timeline: Weekly Meeting Goals  

**Q2:** What is your goals that your group want to achieve in each weekly meeting ?

Prior to 10/5:
    * Decide how the app will tell cultural stories.
    * Research examples (like Never Alone) to inspire how to integrate storytelling with interactivity.

During week of 10/12:
* Data & Content Planning:
    * Curate an initial list of with short cultural notes.
    * Research Chicago restaurants/markets to feature.
    * Decide whether to use an external API (e.g., maps/restaurant data) or create a custom dataset.

During week of 10/19:
* Backend + Structure:
    * Build basic data structures for storing dishes/cultural stories/locations.
    * Import some sample data to test.

During week of 10/26:
* Frontend Prototype:
    * Create simple UI to browse dishes.
    * Display cultural significance text alongside dish images.
    * Add a basic map/location feature for restaurants.

During week of 11/2:
* Interactivity & Storytelling Layer:
    * Add features for filtering/searching dishes.
    * Experiment with ways to make storytelling more engaging like: pop-up narratives, personal anecdotes, audio snippets
    * Gather feedback on whether the “storytelling” feels authentic and immersive.

During week of 11/9:
* Refinement & Polish:
    * Focus on visual design and cultural expression (fonts, colors, layout that reflect Vietnamese aesthetics).
    * Fix weak points in functionality (bugs, performance).
    * Possibly visit office hours for technical feedback.

Prior to 12/2:
* Prepare presentation/demo version of the project.
* Finalize cultural storytelling elements so the app feels authentic and educational.
* Practice walkthrough of the project for final presentation.

#1 idea - Deepikka
**Idea - Story - Inspiration 4:**
A lot of mythical stories like Greek Mythology stories have been long gone. I studied about them in middle school and haven't heard about them since. These stories hold a lot of wisdom and values within the stories and were passed through generations. They are not only entertaining, but also carry a lot of deep meanings about identity, resilience, and belonging.

**Implementation 4:**
Will create a web-based interactive story that brings such mythical stories to life and can have the users guide the characters through the story by making the decisions for them and experience the same lessons that were taught in the stories.

#2 Idea 
**Saanvi-Idea - Story - Inspiration 5:**
Starting college made me realize how quickly special moments pass by. I take photos of events but rarely capture the feelings behind them - like being nervous during orientation or discovering my favorite study spot. I want to create a simple way for students to preserve their college journey through storytelling, making a digital time capsule to look back on years later.

**Implementation 5:**
Build a web app where students create diary entries with photos, short voice recordings, and text about daily experiences. Users can tag entries by location or milestone, view their timeline chronologically, and share memories with friends. At graduation, the app generates a personalized "College Story Book" digital collection of their four-year journey.

#3 Idea - Mithil
Cultural Recipe Generator

Storytelling:
Rather than presenting recipes as simple instructions, the app frames each dish as a cultural experience. Users not only learn how to cook, but also gain insight into the traditions, history, and personal stories that make each dish unique and meaningful.

Implementation:
Concept:
   The Cultural Recipe Generator is a web-based application that combines culinary exploration with interactive storytelling. Users can discover traditional or fusion recipes while learning about the cultural, historical stories behind each dish.

Features:
   Ingredient-Based Suggestions: Users input ingredients or preferences, and the app suggests culturally inspired dishes.
   Storytelling for Each Recipe: Every recipe includes a narrative explaining its origin, cultural significance, or family tradition.
   Save, Share, and Contribute: Users can save favorite recipes, share them with friends, or contribute their own personal variations.
   Multimedia Support: Recipes include images, step-by-step videos, and optional audio narration to enhance engagement.

#Idea 4  – Samith – Inspiration:
The USA is home to a large collection of races, cultures, ideas, and people. However, much of this diversity is a shallow copy of the originals. For deeply cultural people, this creates a void of festivals, rituals, and experiences that connect them to their roots. Many miss out on the joy of celebrations, community gatherings, and traditions that make cultures vibrant.

Implementation:
A web application that collects festivals, temple events, and cultural occasions according to the calendar. The app will:

Provide a cultural calendar showing upcoming events.

Allow filtering by culture, religion, or location.

Integrate maps to show nearby temples and cultural centers.

Send reminders and notifications for important cultural occasions.

This way, users can experience festivals, attend gatherings, and reconnect with their cultural identity even while living in the USA.


# Idea Finalization

**From 5 project ideas you have above, please choose one of the project that you are going with for the rest of the semester. Explain why you are going with that project**

Cultural Calendar Web Application

Proposed by our teamate: Samith Sudini Reddy

Motive

Although we researched quite alot of different directions for the project, we thought that this Cultural Calendar app gave us the greatest opportunity to intersect storytelling, cultural representation as well as interactivity, all of which is aligns with our goal.

Many students and residents in the USA are from diverse backgrounds, but they often feel disconnected from their own authentic cultural celebrations, rituals and events. This app tackles a real social issue that creates a shared place for students or residents to explore Cultural Festivals, temple events or get-togethers that are coming up.

We have chosen to focus on this project because of:

Cultural Relevance: The app creates connections to build community and honor diversity through events.

Storytelling capacity: Each festival or event can be enhanced through cultural notes, traditions or personal stories to provide some meaningful content to the app experience.

Technical Challenge: The ability to create multiple layers like database design to store data from users, third APIs for maps/event and authentification gives us an opportunity to conduct well rounded full-stack web development.

Scalability: The app could be launched with local events and could later grow to events across the spectrum that will be decided by all of us teammates.

This project captures well both technical learning expectations and cultural engagement creative outcomes.
