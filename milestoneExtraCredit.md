Project Description & Goals
Our project, the Cultural Calendar Web Application, aims to create an interactive digital space where users can discover and learn about cultural events, festivals, and traditions happening around them. The primary goal is to build community connections and promote cultural diversity by giving users easy access to cultural events.
Why This Layout and Flow Were Chosen
1.	Login Page:
The project starts with a simple login/registration screen to authenticate users. This allows specific cultural preferences to be saved for future use.
2.	Main Dashboard (Menu Screen):
After logging in, users are guided to a clean dashboard containing four main options, which are About Us, Info, Events, and Explore. This is to keep the interface simple and intuitive, and allow the users to choose where they want to go from here.
3.	Profile Page:
The user profile includes fields for picture, name, age, country, and culture. This personalization helps with giving recommendations based on the user’s background and preferred festivals.
4.	Calendar Page:
A visually minimal calendar layout displays upcoming events by date. Filters such as culture, location, and place help users refine what they’re searching for. This structure was chosen to mirror Google Calendar, so users instantly understand how to navigate.
5.	Explore Section:
This section allows users to browse through pinned events and new cultural celebrations. The visuals make it easier to discover events briefly and interact with the application.
Assumptions and Limitations
•	Assumptions:
o	Users will have stable internet access to fetch real-time event data.
o	Event information can be retrieved through APIs from cultural organizations or local databases.
•	Limitations:
o	Event submissions from users may require moderation to avoid inaccurate or duplicate listings.
o	Accessibility features like screen reader compatibility still need to be addressed
Future Improvements / Open Questions
1.	User-Generated Event Submissions:
Allow verified users to submit their own cultural events, which can then be reviewed and added to the public calendar.
2.	Push Notifications & Reminders:
Notify users of upcoming festivals or events related to their cultural interests.
